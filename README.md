# Latex WSConfig_Beamer

Hi! This project contains a template for creating beamer presentations with focus on separating the configurations from the main file where the slides content is located.

## Usage

### Simplest way

Clone the repo and change the slides inside the `presentation.tex` file.

The customizations (like packages, preamble configurations, etc.) can be done inside the `wsconfig_beamer.tex`. 

### Cloning the GitHub repository

Install VSCode and the extension Latex Workshop. Then:

1. Clone the repo
2. Enter the directory
3. Rename the `presentation.tex` file to whathever you need
4. Open the directory in VSCode (`$ code .`)
5. Edit the text file while see the preview in VSCode
6. A lot of files will be created, you can run `make` to remove them
